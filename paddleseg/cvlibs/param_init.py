    ImageNet Classification <https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01852>`
    by Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren and Jian Sun. This is a
    robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier
    nonlinearities. In case of Uniform distribution, the range is [-x, x], where

    In case of Normal distribution, the mean is 0 and the standard deviation
    is
    .. math::
