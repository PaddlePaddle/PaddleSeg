* Maskformer support different network setting including tiny, small, base and large. The training result of base and large is not provided, but it should be consistent with the paper

* Maskformer-Base and Maskformer-Large will be evaled with multi-scale and flip as the original codebase .

* Please use cuda 11.2 rather than cuda 10.2 to prevent computation bugs.
